# WORKLOG

- 2026-01-13: Created `docs/COST_AND_PRICING.md` with per-slide costs, pricing models, and implementation checklist.
- 2026-01-14: Implemented working Go PPTX renderer using baliance.com/gooxml library. Added full template spec parsing, PPTX generation with text placeholders, and comprehensive unit tests.
- 2026-01-14: Wired renderer to worker jobs. Worker now processes render/preview/export jobs end-to-end, stores assets, and updates job status. Added ListQueued method to store interfaces, implemented memory and postgres asset storage, and comprehensive worker tests.
- 2026-01-14: Added asset download endpoint implementation with two routes: GET /v1/assets/{id} and GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/assets/{filename}. Improved asset type handling, proper Content-Type/Content-Disposition headers, and comprehensive unit tests. Fixed Go renderer temp file issues.
- 2026-01-14: Added job status polling to Next.js frontend. Created GET /v1/jobs/{jobId} endpoint, job polling hook, status/download components, and updated export flow with real-time status updates.
- 2026-01-14: Implemented preview thumbnail generation for PPTX slides. Added GenerateSlideThumbnails method to both Go and Python renderers, updated worker to create multiple preview assets per slide, and created ThumbnailGallery component for frontend display with download functionality.
- 2026-01-14: Replaced dev auth with NextAuth.js. Added GitHub OAuth provider, session management, JWT tokens, user/org creation flow, and updated all API routes to use real authentication instead of dev headers.
- 2026-01-14: Started organization management implementation. Created .ai/ directory for tracking, analyzed existing auth structure, and began implementing org/team management features.
- 2026-01-14: Implemented organization management API routes, UI pages, and role-based permissions. Added comprehensive tests for org/team management features.
- 2026-01-14: Added organization switcher component and completed E2E flow tests. All tests passing (32 total).
- 2026-01-14: Implemented comprehensive job queue resilience features. Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff, job deduplication to prevent duplicate work, dead-letter queue for failed jobs after max retries, error classification (transient vs permanent), and admin endpoints for DLQ monitoring and manual retry. Updated both memory and postgres stores with new job fields (retryCount, maxRetries, deduplicationID, etc.) and added comprehensive tests covering all retry scenarios and edge cases.
- 2026-01-14: Started object storage integration. Analyzed current in-memory asset storage implementation, identified need for S3/GCS integration with signed URLs, and began planning storage backend replacement.
- 2026-01-15: Completed object storage integration with S3/GCS support and signed URLs. Updated server factory to use ObjectStorage interface instead of LocalStorage, added StorageFactory for backend selection, integrated signed URL generation in asset handlers and download endpoints, updated export functionality to upload to object storage, and added comprehensive integration tests. System now supports local filesystem, S3, and GCS backends with proper signed URL generation for secure asset access.
- 2026-01-15: Implemented Hugging Face AI orchestrator for template generation. Added HuggingFaceClient with support for Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 model, implemented prompt engineering with system prompts and few-shot examples, created AI service interface and implementation with brand kit support, updated POST /v1/templates/generate endpoint to use AI generation with fallback to stub spec, added comprehensive unit tests for all components, and verified end-to-end functionality with API integration tests.
- 2026-01-15: Implemented advanced visual editor for template layouts. Created full-featured drag-and-drop canvas editor with placeholder positioning, resize handles, grid snap, and alignment guides. Added theme editor with color palette picker, typography controls, spacing controls, and live preview. Implemented validation system with constraint checking, visual warnings, and auto-fix suggestions. Updated template page integration with visual mode toggle and real-time preview. Added comprehensive test suite for utils, components, integration, and API endpoints.
- 2026-01-15: Created complete Railway deployment configuration. Added railway.json with multi-service setup (API + PostgreSQL), optimized Dockerfile.railway with multi-stage builds and health checks, deployment scripts with environment variable management, database migration setup, comprehensive deployment documentation, health monitoring scripts, and GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated deployments.
